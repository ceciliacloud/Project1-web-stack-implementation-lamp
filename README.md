## **Prerequisites for the project**

Before starting this project, it was necessary to set up a virtual enviornment. In order to achieve this, first, I created a free [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/)and then I created a virtual server using the Ubuntu Server OS.

You may be wondering, 'what is AWS'? Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the leading Cloud Service Provider in the world. AWS offers a wide variety of databases and services for different types of applications. This allows users to choose the right tool for the job while receiving the best cost and performance. 

AWS offers a Free Tier for newly registered account users. This enables users to try out some AWS services free of charge within certain usage limits. For this project, I utilized the [EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/features/) compute service, which is covered by the Free Tier!

Here is how I did it:

1. I began by registering and setting up an [AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start) and following the directions on the screen.

2. Once I had setup my account, I logged in as the IAM user. I navigated to the top-right of my screen and selected my preferred region (the closest to me). Next, I navigated to the EC2 service, and launched an instance. I selected a Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS (HVM) as the Amazon Machine Image (AMI)and selected a storage t2.micro as the instance type.
